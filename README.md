# This version is no longer maintained.

This library version was ment to be used with PHP 5.6/7.0. However, these versions of PHP reached [official end of life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) in January 2019.

Following this, this library will not receive further updates. Upgrade to [matej-client-php][original] (requires PHP 7.1+) as soon as possible.

**Please note this version is transpiled from [PHP 7.1+ version][original] of the client. So:**

- If you use PHP 7.1+, use the [original library][original]. 
- If you still use PHP 5.6/7.0, temporarily use this library, but we encourage you to update PHP as soon as possible - the PHP 5.6/7.0 is [no longer actively supported](http://php.net/supported-versions.php) by the PHP Group.
- This repository is read-only, meaning all pull-requests, issues etc. must be directed to the [main repository][original].
- Note this version does not contain some features the original version has - mainly type checks, so it may by not as convenient to use as the original. So once again, we recommend using the PHP 7.1+ version.

## Installation

Follow steps from the [installation howto][original-installation] of the original library.

The only difference is you install via Composer package `lmc/matej-client-php5` instead of `lmc/matej-client`.
